#### [Palindrome Checker](https://github.com/AndrewTer/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/Javascript-Algorithms-And-Data-Structures-Projects/Palindrome-Checker)
A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.<br/>
> Note:<br/>
  You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.<br/>
