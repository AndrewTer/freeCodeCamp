* #### [Roman Numeral Converter](https://github.com/AndrewTer/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/Javascript-Algorithms-And-Data-Structures-Projects/Roman-Numeral-Converter/main.js)
  Convert the given number into a roman numeral.
  
  All roman numerals answers should be provided in upper-case.

* #### [Caesars Cipher](https://github.com/AndrewTer/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/Javascript-Algorithms-And-Data-Structures-Projects/Caesars-Cipher/main.js)
  One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipherthe meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

  A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' ↔ 'N', 'B' ↔ 'O' and so on.

  Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

  All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.
