      <h2>Facts</h2>
      <section id="facts">
        <p class="fact">He never tried drugs.</p>
        <p class="fact">He has a daughter. Leo managed to get attached to one of the orphans during the filming and even adopted her, but does not raise the girl, and monthly transfers money for her maintenance, expenses and often calls her.</p>
        <p class="fact">He knows how to save money. When Leo was very young and still could not boast of wealth, he never left tips in bars and restaurants, where he often had a rest. He prefers Toyota Prius. He does not fly in economy class.</p>
        <p class="fact">Leonardo di Caprio, together with La Colombe Torrefaction, a coffee roasting company, decided to finance a number of environmental projects. To do this, a new extra-class LYON coffee line was created.</p>
        <p class="fact">In 2013, in an interview, Mark Wahlberg said that DiCaprio initially did not want to play with him in the film "Basketball Player Diaries", and Mark himself was not enthusiastic about his partner. Nevertheless, the actors managed to work together.</p>
        <p class="fact">Shark Attack: In 2006, Leo was diving in Cape Town, South Africa. For the safety of the stars, DiCaprio was lowered into the water in a special cage, and it was she who saved the actor from a huge white shark.</p>
        <p class="fact">Leo's mother was born in Germany and taught her son her native language. DiCaprio's parents divorced when he was still a very young child, so his mother and a German grandmother were engaged in his upbringing.</p>
        <p class="fact">He wanted to change his name to Lenny Williams. When Leo was 10 years old, his agent advised him to change his name to Lenny Williams so that he would be more willingly given roles. It seemed to the agent that the name of the actor sounds too "ethnically".</p>
        <p class="fact">He was never married. DiCaprio had so many tumultuous novels with famous beauties, but he never married. He met with Demi Moore, and Blake Lively, and even with Naomi Campbell.</p>
        <p class="fact">He was once a member of The Pussy Posse. At the beginning of his career, Leo was a regular in bars. The guys he hung out with soon became known as The Pussy Posse. The company included Toby Maguire, Harmony Corin, David Blaine.</p>
        <p class="fact">He generously donates money to charity. As mentioned earlier, DiCaprio does a lot of charity work. In 2013 alone, he donated millions of dollars from his royalties.</p>
